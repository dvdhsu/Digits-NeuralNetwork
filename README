# Neural Network for MNIST testset

This neural network contains four layers: a 784 node input layer, a 400 node hidden layer, a 50 node hidden layer, and a 10 node output layer. 

With the provided weights.mat (found through training as provided in train.m), this neural network scores a 97.49 on [Yann LeCun's MNIST set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

To train and test the neural network yourself, launch Octave and run digits.m.
